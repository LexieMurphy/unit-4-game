# unit-4-game

In this activity we will create a number guessing game.

## Instructions

* You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

* There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

* You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score gets above the random number.

* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click it.

* Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.


* **NOTE:** You can start the game by clicking the "Let's Play" button. 

* **HINT:** Clicking the "Let's Play" button will reset the game if you would like to start over.
